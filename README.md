<p>This repository contains my project completed as part of the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/sukis/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Certification</a> from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp">freeCodeCamp</a>.</p>

<h2>Telephone Number Validator Project</h2>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>In the US, phone numbers can be formatted in many ways. This project involves building an app that validates whether a given input is a correctly formatted US phone number.</p>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>This project was completed following specific instructions provided by freeCodeCamp. The requirements included creating an input element for the phone number, a button to trigger the validation, and a display element for the result. The app ensures that the input is a valid US phone number according to various accepted formats and displays whether the number is valid or not.</p>
